## 5. Arduino Nano board

I also learned about Arduino boards, the Nano ones in particular. My team would work on this once a week for a while and we'd use the Arduino online editor to change the way things on the board worked. We were able to use a button to turn a light attached to the board on and make it work the other way around.

## 6. Making Webpages Interactive

I began but didn't finish the Making Webpages Interactive module on Khan Academy. I didn't finish it but I really liked the idea of making webpages interactive through code and creating things that provide an interactive experience. 

## 7. Git-it workflow

I completed the tutorial on Git-It which taught some things about branching, merging pull requests and other things. This was important for my workflow because it showed me ways to efficiently get things done.

# Languages I've learned

1. Turing (ICS2O) - The first language I learned in Computer Science was Turing and it really helped me understand how programming and coding works because of how simple to use it is.
2. Actionscript (ICS2O) - When we finished Turing we began learning how to code in Actionscript 3.0. It's the language we used for our summative game and it's much more different compared to other languages we learned.
3. C++ (ICS3U) - We learned how to code in C++ in ICS3U last year. I prefer this language to the ones we learned in ICS2O because of how it has more depth and features compared to Turing and is much more easier to understand and code in compared to Actionscript 3.0
4. Javascript (ICS4U) - We learned how to program in JS this year in ICS4U. This language lets you create pictures and make things move with code but was harder for me to understand at first.
5. HTML/CSS (ICS4U) - We learned this language this year as well. I found it interesting to learn that this is how websites are created and the syntax of HTML and CSS.
6. Markdown (ICS4U) - We learned how to program in this language for some websites we made this year. I prefer this over HTML for the simplicity and in fact, this website you're reading was written in Markdown!

## Some repositories I contributed to

# Learning experiences as a programmer

I learned alot of important things in ICS4U this year. Something very important is that you should always ask for help when you need it. That way, you'll learn how to solve your problem and can use that knowledge to help you in future projects. It's also important to make sure your code is clear and easy to understand with the way you format things. Finally, it helps if you go over instructions for challenges and other assignments slowly so that you don't miss any important details. This has happened to me several times because I read through the instructions too quickly

# Intentions for the future

* I want to continue to code in JS because I feel like I have lots of room with that language and with object-oriented programming in general.
* Continuing to work on my Github profile and uploading code I make and have made will also be beneficial. I think this way because all my code will be in one place to view. For example, if I'm applying for a job or for a school after high school then I can use my profile to display my code. I didn't like Github very much at first, but now it's become a very useful tool that I will use in the future.
* I want to pursue a degree in Computer Science for my post-secondary education and I'll do that by taking the necessary courses in high school.
* I want to learn more about making webpages interactive because I wasn't able to get through that module on Khan Academy.

# Data

Mr. O taught us how important Data types are and how they are used for example lists.

List(x, y) L= [n1, n2, n3..., ny]

Ordered sets oset(x, y)O=[n1, n2,.. ny]

Multiset Mset(x, y)m=[n1, n2... ny]

Sets (x, y)s=(n1, n2.. ny)

# FreeCodeCamp portfolio 

For this aspect, I want to continue to improve my competency in Javascript and I think a great way of doing that would be to work on Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures. It has lots of things we did earlier on in JS which will help refresh my memory on things we haven't done in some time and somethings I need to practise. What's most important is some things that I haven't learned yet in JS that will open my eyes to some new things that I can do in JS.
